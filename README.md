# Gatsby Test

A simple project to take a look at the Gatsby Framework, by fetching with ***Graphql*** and creating pages for each element of the fetched data with ***gatsby-node***.

The core project is developed with GatsbyJS and ReactJS, and it is hosted on Netlify. It feeds from a Headless CMS hosted in Heroku.

The Netlify application is configured with incremental builds, triggered every time a user modifies the API thanks to WebHooks.
